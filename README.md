## API
The API I used is called LitterTRAK and it is a dataset from the Prince George's
Country Open Data Portal. The API tracks "the collection of trash and debris 
by County residents, community organizations and businesses during individual 
and group clean-up events".

## CSS Frameworks
I did not use an external CSS framework to stylize this website project. I used
the CSS from the class labs, and I made some slight adjusts to coloring and border
styles. 

## Visualization
This project displays a bar chart utilizing code from the Charts.js library.
The x-axis displays the major watersheds and the y-axis show how many cleanups
occurred at each cleanup. 

## Problem to solve
The project is meant to show the magnitude and concentration of cleanups in the 
watersheds of Prince George's County. The bar chart will show that some watersheds
have a greater frequency of cleanups than others, which implies that there is more
trash at those watersheds.

I also wanted the user to be able to see the 'weight' of the cleanups, and so the
data filter is based on the number of bags used to complete a cleanup. You can see
which watersheds have light debris by setting the filter to 1 bag and then compare
and contrast the values between the different watersheds. Simiarly, you can see which
watersheds had big cleanup jobs by setting the filter to 10 bags and comparing and contrasting the values between the different watersheds.
