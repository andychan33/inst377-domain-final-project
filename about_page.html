                    <p>The main focus of this site is to visualize how many
                        cleanups there are in the major watersheds of Prince 
                        George's County via a bar chart. You can also see how
                        many lightweight or heavyweight cleanups there were at
                        each watershed by using the number of bags filter.

                <h3>How to use this site?</h3>
                <div class="box">
                    First, click the "Load Cleanup Data" button.
                    A bar chart will appear on the right.
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h4>Examine Random Data</h4>
                        Click 'Generate List'. This produces a list of 10 cleanup
                        operations under the bar chart. Each item in the list contains 
                        the date of the cleanup and how many bags were used.
                        The bar chart above should change to reflect the data of
                        these 10 cleanups. You can click 'Generate List' again to 
                        produce a new list.
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h4>Filter the Data</h4>
                        The data is filtered based on how many bags were used to complete
                        a cleanup. 
                        <p>To use the text input filter, input a number from 1 to 10,
                            click on some empty space, and wait for the bar chart and 
                            list to update to reflect the filtered data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To use the dropdown menu filter, click to bring down the
                            dropdown menu and select a number by clicking on it. Then wait
                            for the bar chart and list to update to reflect the filtered data.
                        </p>
